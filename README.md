# Project Overview

Welcome to the  `MAp My World?`  SLAM project! In this project, We will learn to utilize ROS AMCL package to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in the Gazebo simulation environments.


-   Create a ROS package that launches a custom robot model in a custom Gazebo world
    
-   Utilize the ROS RTMAP package and the Tele-Operation / Navigation Stack to localize the robot
    
-   Explore, add, and tune specific parameters corresponding to each package to achieve the best possible slam map results


### Native Installation & Virtual Machine

If you are working with a native ROS installation or using a VM, some of the following package might need to be installed. You could install them as shown below:

```
$ rosdep install -i rtabmap_ros
```


# Teleop Package

If you prefer to control your robot to help it localize itself as you did in the lab, you would need to add the  `teleop`  node to your package. Thanks to the ROS community, we could use  `ros-teleop`  package to send command to the robot using keyboard or controller.

Clone the  `ros-teleop`  package to your  `src`  folder:

```
cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros-teleop/teleop_twist_keyboard
```

Build the package and source the setup script:

```
cd ..
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

Now you could run the  `teleop`  script as is described in the  `README`  file:

```
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
```
or 
```
roslaunch my_robot teleop.launch
```


## Create the  `my_robot`  Package

**Create and initialize a  `catkin_ws`**
Feel free to skip if you already have a  `catkin_ws`.

```
$ mkdir -p /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src
$ cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_init_workspace
```
#### Clone or Download This Project Under the /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src
```
$ cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/studian/RoboND-P4-Map_My_World.git my_robot
```

-   map.pgm of 'my_robot/maps/' must be download in the link: 'http://naver.me/xH2bOZOO'

## Build Package

```
$ cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```

# Launching

You have your robot, your map, your localization and navigation nodes. Letâ€™s launch it all and test it!

First, launch the simulation:

```
$ cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch <YOUR PACKAGE NAME> <YOUR WORLD>.launch
$ roslaunch my_robot world.launch
```

In a new terminal, launch the  `teleop_twist_keyboard`  launch file:
```
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
```

In a new terminal, launch the  `map`  launch file:

```
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch <YOUR PACKAGE NAME> mapping.launch
$ roslaunch my_robot mapping.launch
```

## Open mapping database:

```
$ rtabmap-databaseViewer /root/.ros/rtabmap.db
```
Download rtabmap.db file from : http://naver.me/Gi9UICa9

Need to add some windows to get a better view of the relevant information, so:

```
	Say yes to using the database parameters
	View -> Constraint View
	View -> Graph View
```
